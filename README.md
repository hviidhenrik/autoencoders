# Autoencoders
Just a repo to mess around with different kinds of autoencoder models

The first implemented autoencoder is a standard feed-forward network with an 
optional denoising functionality. 
At the time of writing it achieves a validation accuracy on noisy data of around
0.1470 using the Adam optimizer.
